| 1.0 Project Overview |
| 1.1 Public description (unless omission is justified, e.g. high-level security classification) |
| This project will include a trade study report in a word document format to identify and recommend the most suitable vision systems capable of performing aircraft inspections within a hangar environment. |
| 1.2 Background information |
| Currently, aircraft surface inspections are conducted manually and documented using paper-based methods. These inspections are carried out both before and after each flight, with additional checks performed every 28 days, which differ from routine pre-flight and post-flight assessments. These inspections cover large areas as they involve the entire aircraft surface, and they are conducted visually by experts. A significant limitation of the current process is the absence of a system that tracks the progression of damage or degradation over time. Furthermore, the criteria for passing or failing an inspection can vary depending on the proximity and extent of the damage or degradation.Previous research, such as the Digital Reconfigurable Additive Manufacturing facilities for Aerospace (D) project by the Research Company (RC), explored the use of CAD models, plane geometry alignment, and visualisation tools (tablet and VR) to review damages identified in previous inspections. However, the alignment of CAD models with the aircraft surface encountered difficulties due to the visual similarity between the aircraft and its background. This project used a three-point alignment system in VR, with a GUI feature to update damage records using synthetic data with historic records for tracking degradation over time. |
| 1.3 Project objectives and/or business case |
| **Project Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to research and find the best vision system to implement an advanced, digitalised aircraft surface inspection system that leverages cutting-edge technologies. This will enhance the overall efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of aircraft inspections.**Hardware and Software Selection: A Comprehensive Trade Study**This project will entail a detailed evaluation and selection process for the most suitable machine vision hardware and software to enable precise CAD-to-aircraft alignment and efficient inspection in a hangar environment. The study will involve the following sections:**Technology Integration for CAD Alignment.**This section will focus on the desktop evaluation of various hardware and software solutions, exploring their capability to integrate with CAD models and align with real aircraft surfaces, even when the aircraft is not in a consistent position.**Fixed-Camera Systems for Damage Detection.**This section will examine the use of fixed cameras for detecting damage and tracking degradation on aircraft surfaces, with a specific emphasis on their suitability for hangar environments.**Implementation Challenges in Large-Scale Environments such as a Hangar.**This section will analyse the challenges and limitations associated with deploying machine vision systems in large-scale hangar environments. Key factors to be analysed include lighting conditions, working distances, camera and lighting positioning, ambient light variability, potential glare from reflective surfaces, shadows and scalability considerations. Additionally, data density considerations will be addressed by estimating the approximate number of images required to comprehensively cover the surface of a representative aircraft.**Decision Matrix for Hardware and Software Selection.**This section will include a comprehensive decision matrix comparing fixed-camera systems and software solutions based on key factors such as resolution, field of view, processing capabilities, cost, and real-time performance. The aim is to identify the optimal combination to enhance inspection accuracy and efficiency.**Recommendations for Future Monitoring Solutions.**This section will propose future work involving the deployment of cameras mounted on hangar structures to monitor the upper aircraft surfaces, aiming to extend the coverage and capabilities of the inspection system.**Support route mapping workshop for inspection.**Support the route mapping workshop for inspection by presenting the research findings. Collect participant feedback during the session to produce a recommendation for inspection processes.**Recommendations Based on Workshop Outcomes.**Lastly, this section will summarise the findings and recommendations from the workshop, outlining actionable steps for further development and implementation of the system. |

| 3.0 Scope |
| 3.1. In scope |
| Assess Environmental Factors in the Hangar: Analyse the lighting conditions, working distances, and other environmental factors that may impact the performance of the vision system in a hangar environment. This will include variables such as ambient light variability, potential glare from reflective surfaces, shadows, and the spatial layout of the hangar. Evaluate how these conditions might influence image acquisition, processing accuracy, and overall system reliability. This analysis will be included in the final report.Research on Machine Vision Hardware: Conduct thorough desktop research on various machine vision hardware options capable of performing accurate CAD-to-aircraft alignment, considering factors such as resolution, field of view, and real-time processing capabilities.Hardware Selection and Evaluation: Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each hardware option. Develop a comprehensive scoring matrix to identify the most suitable equipment for CAD alignment and damage detection based on performance criteria.Report: Produce a detailed report that summarises the research findings, hardware evaluations, and the rationale for the selected equipment. The report will incorporate feedback gathered during the route mapping workshop for inspection, led by Aero Systems. Additionally, create a summary presentation to support and enhance the workshop discussions.Deliver a presentation summarising the research findings from the report and gather feedback during the session to inform future work recommendations. This scope ensures a structured approach to selecting the appropriate technology and establishes a solid foundation for subsequent project phases. |
